WordNet
-------

Plang can make use of the WordNet lexical database to provide access
to huge amounts of information about English words.  Natural language
processing systems in particular can benefit from being able to
ask "Is this a noun/verb/adverb/etc?".  More information on WordNet
can be found here:

Many GNU/Linux distributions have WordNet packages already.  You can
try installing "wordnet" and "wordnet-devel" (or "wordnet-dev")
to see if your distribution already has WordNet.  If not, download
and build it from the sources at the above URL.

Note: WordNet support is optional in Plang, but highly recommended.
If the "configure" script does not detect WordNet, then it will
not build the "words" module.  You will need the "devel" package
installed to build Plang with WordNet.
